Create an Express Rest API which exposes CRUD functionalities for a student/course system. 
Create a student model which describes student information
    (student number, password, first name, last name, address, city, phone number, email, program) 
and also a course model which describes course information 
    (course code, course name, section, semester). 
The information should be stored in a MongoDB database. Use ref to allow a student document to make a reference to corresponding course document. Provide authentication/authorization capabilities using JWT or Passport.  
Create a React front end that allows students to 
login,  post /login 
add a course, post /course 
update a course (for example change the section), put /course
drop a course,   delete /course
list all the courses taken by a student,  get /course?studentId=xxxx
list all students,  get /students
list all courses, and  get /courses
list all students that are taking a given course.  get /students?courseId=xxxx
